Regular Expressions with Route Paths Server

Navigates to "user" and "username" paths, reading, "Hello User!" for both paths. Uses regular expression notation () ? to define an optional additional path within the same route.

Throws a 404 error if path is invalid.

Requires Node.js and npm.
Make sure to include "type": "module" in the package.json file and to install Express, via "npm install express".
To run server, navigate to "reg_express" directory via "cd reg_express" in the terminal.
Run "node index.js" to start server. The console will read, "Server listening on port 3000".
